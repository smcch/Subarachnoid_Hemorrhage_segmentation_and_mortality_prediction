6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. 
This Software is a work in progress for non-commercial research only. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or “bugs” inherent to this type of software development. LICENSOR does not guarantee that the Software will perform error-free or uninterrupted.

The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty disclaimer fails of its essential purpose. 

8. TERMINATION.  
You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of Software and notifying the LICENSOR. This Agreement will terminate immediately on notice from LICENSOR if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

You may not assign this agreement or give or transfer the Software or an interest in it to another individual or entity. Neither party shall be responsible for failure to fulfil any obligation due to causes beyond its control. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is LICENSOR responsible for any third party claims against Licensee. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and LICENSOR relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting communication between the parties relating to the Software.
