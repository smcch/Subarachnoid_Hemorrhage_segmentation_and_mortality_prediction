This repository contains the Python implementation of the papers: 

- "Mortality Prediction of Patients with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Using a Deep Learning Model Based on an Initial Brain CT Scan". Garc√≠a-Garc√≠a S, Cepeda S, M√ºller D, Mosteiro A, Torn√© R, Agudo S, de la Torre N, Arrese I, Sarabia R. Brain Sciences.  2024; 14(1):10. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci14010010 
- "A Fully Automated Pipeline Using Swin Transformers for Deep Learning-Based Blood Segmentation on Head Computed Tomography Scans After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage". Garc√≠a-Garc√≠a S, Cepeda S, Arrese I, Sarabia R. World Neurosurg. Published online August 5, 2024. https://doi:10.1016/j.wneu.2024.07.216

The repository introduces a streamlined pipeline for:

1) Automatic Bleeding Segmentation: This segment utilizes the MONAI framework to perform segmentation on non-contrast CT scans from patients diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
    
2) Mortality Risk Prediction: Predicts the mortality risk within a span of 3 months post-admission using the AUCMEDI framework.

The comprehensive pipeline encompasses DICOM file preprocessing, automatic segmentation using a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based model, mortality prediction through the AUCMEDI model, and the generation of a detailed report. This report includes prediction outcomes, segmentation files, and a volumetric analysis of the bleeding.

## Installation

Download the Miniconda installer:

```
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

Run the installer script:

```
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

Initialize Miniconda:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Create a virtual environment:

```
conda create --name myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```
conda activate myenv
```

Replace 'myenv' with your desired name.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sah-mortality-prediction.git
```

Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned.

Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Use the following command to install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Note: Additional dependencies such as FSL, ANTs, and dcm2niix need to be installed separately and added to the system path. Please follow the instructions below to install them:

### Installing External Dependencies

#### dcm2niix

1. Visit the dcm2niix repository: [https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)
2. Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository to install dcm2niix.
3. Add dcm2niix to the system path.

#### FSL

1. Visit the FSL installation page: [https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation)
2. Follow the installation instructions provided to install FSL.
3. Add FSL to the system path.

## Usage

For Mac OS users: to avoid error reading .DS_Store files, please enter this command line to delet those files from the input and output directories:

```
find /path/to/directory -name .DS_Store -type f -delete
```

replace /path/to/directory  with the actual path of the input and output directory.


### Command Line Execution for mortality prediction task

Prepare your input data:

Create a directory containing the DICOM files of the SAH patients.
Each patient should have a separate subdirectory with their DICOM files.
Ensure that the DICOM files contain the necessary information for the prediction (e.g., CT scans).

Run the SAH Mortality Prediction pipeline:

```
python SAH_mortality_prediction.py -i /path/to/input -o /path/to/output --model 3D.DenseNet121.model.best.loss.hdf5 -g 0
```

Replace /path/to/input with the path to the directory containing the DICOM files, and /path/to/output with the desired output directory. The --model argument specifies the path to the AUCMEDI model file.

### Command Line Execution for automatic segmetation

Setting Up the Pretrained Model:

Begin by downloading the pretrained model for the pipeline.

Click on the link below to access the model:



[Download Pretrained Model] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ChgWWranUdj6w3NXXy_RDP2gRQTMNc35/view?usp=sharing)

Ensure you place the downloaded model in the appropriate directory as mentioned in subsequent steps or as required by the pipeline.

Expected Input Format:
Ensure your processed non-contrast CT scan in NIfTI format is structured as follows:

```
input_folder/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subject_ID/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subject_ID_ct.nii.gz
```

Then run the comman:

```
python inference_2.py --input_dir --output_dir
```

### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Execution

Alternatively, you can use the graphical user interface (GUI) for execution of both tasks (segmentation and mortality prediction). Run the following command:
```
python gui.py
```
This will launch the GUI, allowing you to interactively select the input and output directories without specify the AUCMEDI model file.

View the results:

The pipeline will generate processed NIfTI files and a predictions.csv file in the output directory.
Additionally, a report in PDF format will be created for each patient, providing the prediction results, volume slices, and XAI slices.
The report files will be named as report_<subject_id>.pdf.
