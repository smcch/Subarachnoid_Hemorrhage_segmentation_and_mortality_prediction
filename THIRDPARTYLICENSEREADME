Title to Software and all associated intellectual and industrial property rights is retained by LICENSOR and/or its licensors. You shall keep intact all authorship, copyright, patent or trademark notices and all notices that refer to the Software and the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the LICENSOR, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software and reproducing the content of the copyright notice. 

6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. 
This Software is a work in progress for non-commercial research only. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or “bugs” inherent to this type of software development. LICENSOR does not guarantee that the Software will perform error-free or uninterrupted. To the maximum extent permitted by obligatorily applicable law, the Software is provided without further warranties of any kind, including without limitation satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, or non-infringement of intellectual or industrial property rights. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Software. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  
Except in the cases of physical damages directly caused to natural persons, and to the maximum extent permitted by obligatorily applicable law, in no event will LICENSOR or its licensors be liable for any direct or for indirect or consequential damages, however caused, arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use Software; including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage and lost revenue or profit, even if the LICENSOR has been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty disclaimer fails of its essential purpose. 

8. TERMINATION.  
You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of Software and notifying the LICENSOR. This Agreement will terminate immediately on notice from LICENSOR if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement.  Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately should any Software become, or in either party's opinion be likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement of any intellectual or industrial property right. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of Software. Provisions that survive termination or expiration include those relating to limitation of liability limitation and others which by their nature are intended to survive and apply to both parties' respective successors and assignees.

9. GOVERNING LAW / JURISDICTION.  
Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by the law of the domicile of the Licensor.  No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. Any action, conflict or dispute resulting from this License and use of the Software will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the domicile of the Licensor. 

10. OTHER.
If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If this is not possible, the License will terminate. You may not assign this agreement or give or transfer the Software or an interest in it to another individual or entity. Neither party shall be responsible for failure to fulfil any obligation due to causes beyond its control. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is LICENSOR responsible for any third party claims against Licensee. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and LICENSOR relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting communication between the parties relating to the Software. No modification of this license will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorised representative of each party.
